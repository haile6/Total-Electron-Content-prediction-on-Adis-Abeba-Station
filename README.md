# vTEC Prediction Dashboard

This project provides a **dashboard for predicting Vertical Total Electron Content (vTEC)** at Addis Ababa Station using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and interactive visualization of predictions.

## Features

- Data cleaning and outlier handling
- Feature engineering for vTEC prediction
- Machine learning models: light gbm 
- Interactive dashboard with plots and key performance indicators
- Comparison of model performance

## Dataset

The dataset contains vTEC measurements from 2008–2021, with some updates. The data is processed for machine learning modeling.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haile6/Total-Electron-Content-prediction-on-Adis-Abeba-Station.git
